That’s something I thought only pretentious people said, but I am going to be one of those people today. Today and for the next 2 weeks I am going to be in Europe.</p>

                                <li><p>I’m an extremly nerdy programmer who just happens to also be a writer - an extremly weird one. Every time you learn a new programming language, you write a hello world program to introduce you to the language and teach you about basic program structure and syntax. Well, this is a blog not a program. This is my ‘Hello Blog’, my introduction to the world of blogging, the place where I learn the syntax of the bloggingshpere, where I learn what I want my style to be and what I want these short bursts of my rambling mind to be focused on. I want it to be unique like me so, that means its going to get pretty strange from time to time.</p>
