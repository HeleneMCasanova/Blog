            <p>I’m an extremly nerdy programmer who just happens to also be a writer - an extremly weird one. Every time you learn a new programming language, you write a hello world program to introduce you to the language and teach you about basic program structure and syntax. Well, this is a blog not a program. This is my ‘Hello Blog’, my introduction to the world of blogging, the place where I learn the syntax of the bloggingshpere, where I learn what I want my style to be and what I want these short bursts of my rambling mind to be focused on. I want it to be unique like me so, that means its going to get pretty strange from time to time.</p>

<p>I built this site using Jekyll which was an incredible learning experience and although it took me a few days to finally wrap my head around how the project structure worked, I had an excuse to build another site from the ground up. I had so much fun relearning the in’s and out’s of the git command line. This project finally forced me to fix my github authenication issue so my github contribution screen will soon be a sea of forrest green.</p>

<p>I began this project because I am going to Europe soon and rather than bombarding everyone on my Facebook page with a billion pictures of my <em>great life</em>, I would start a blog and post about my two weeks of paradise. That idea eventually escalated into me beginning blogging again because I had started one at the beginning of the year, but had to drop it after I started the publishing process for my novel.</p>

<p>I gone through a lot of things this semester along with a lot of soul searching and understanding who I truly want to be in life. Just as my book made me realize that I can be a writer, this blog is a new chapter of my life that will help me grow as a person.</p>
