This week was an adventuous one! Learning the difference between functional and non-functional has helped in understanding how to start any software or program. 

Functional Requirements have to do with the functionality of the system or what the system does with the computation. Non-functional Requirements refers to non-functional properties or systems qualities. Examples include security accuracy, performance, cost or usability. Do not always have clear satisfaction criteria.

I have a tendency to start projects and focus on the details; this tendency was discussed in the video from this week. This tendecy leads me often drop projects I'm working on halfway through. There were several different points that were dicussed to avoid this habit. I am going to take these tips into this class as well as into my future projects and classes.
