I'm currently sitting in Boston Logan Aiport waiting to leave for Paris, well I'm actually going to Iceland first and then to Paris. I hope I don't get jetlag. That's something I thought only pretentious people said, but I am going to be one of those people today. Today and for the next 2 weeks I am going to be in Europe.

I sit with this notion in my mind, but it doesn't feel real because I never thought I could ever get here in my life. I thought my life would end up being a simple one, as a kid, that's all I've ever wanted. For a long time, that was all I wanted - to be normal, but I'm never going to be and I have to learn to accept that. 

People keep telling me that this journey to Europe on my own is going to change me. I think it's already starting to and I haven't left the contient yet. Cheers to new adventures because I can finally drink.
