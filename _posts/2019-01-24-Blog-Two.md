This week was learning more about the difference between features and requirements. It was imperative to understand why we need to define requirements before we start building anything because if going into a project with unclear goals and objectives is just a recipe for disaster. 

People tend to fall into the trap, at the requirements level, by focusing on the features and functionalities of a software product. At the requirements level, you should be focusing on the "what" and not the "how". Before starting this class, I will admit that I would have fallen into this trap whenever I would begin a new project and I would begin focusing on details that may have taken me longer then if I would have followed this model. From now one, when I tackle a new project, I will look at it from the perspective of a client and work my from there because in the end there will always be a client to satisfy.

This week I also got about 2/3 of the way through <i>Don't Make Me Think Revisited</i> and so far I have gotten a lot of useful information that I never would have thought apploed in webpage development. One major idea that I thought was imperative was usability testing, one topic which the author seems to be extremly passionate about. The reason for this is because a lot of usability testing tends to get donâ€™t too little, too late and for all the wrong reasons.
